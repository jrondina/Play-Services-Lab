## Introduction

> ***Note:*** _This should be done independently._

We covered implementing Analytics during the lesson, an extremely important part of play services that lets you track your user interactions with your app. There are many other services, though, and one of the most popular is the location service.

In this lab, you will be creating an app that uses the maps & location services to get the user's current location and show where they are. **Use the links in the additional resources section** to learn about the locations service and how to implement it.

## Exercise

#### Requirements

- Have your Activity use Google Maps
- Use the maps & location API to get the user's current location
- Show the user's location on the map.

**Bonus:**
- Show the user's location on the map with a Marker

#### Deliverable

A working app that meets the requirements above.
